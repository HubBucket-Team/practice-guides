# Practicing PSIP for the first time on your own: how to create and execute a practice improvement plan

If you haven't already, take a look at [why practice PSIP ](why_practice_PSIP.md), [Step 1](how_to.md), [Step 2](how_to_set_goals.md), and [Steps 3 - 4](how_to_create_ptc.md) to get started on your own. The explanation below includes excerpts from the [BSSw PSIP Overview](https://github.com/betterscientificsoftware/PSIP-Tools/blob/master/PSIP-Overview.md):

Assuming you've completed [Step 1](how_to.md), [Step 2](how_to_set_goals.md), and [Steps 3 - 4](how_to_create_ptc.md) of PSIP, you are ready to create and execute your practice improvement plan.

You may decide to execute your practice improvement plan a number of ways (see PTC examples). Honestly, at first you may experience a slowdown, as you and your team work to improve a given practice. You should definitely use complementary SPI methods that you already use to execute your plan! The slowdown you may experience in most cases is proportional to the amount of change, but ideally you and your team should see steady progress on a weekly basis after the initial phase and be able to complete execution of a particular practice improvement within a few months.
