# Practicing PSIP for the first time on your own: how to guide

If you haven't already, take a look at our introduction to PSIP or [why practice PSIP ](why_practice_PSIP.md) if you are wondering whether PSIP is right for you or your team. If you are ready, let's get started!

As you already know PSIP framework is an iterative, incremental, repeatable, cyclic process for improvement planning. The cyclic nature of PSIP enables you and your team to improve overall project quality and achieve science goals by encouraging frequent iteration and reflection. The PSIP workflow is described below. You and your team can work through these steps on your own, or with the assistance of a PSIP facilitator. The process described below assumes that you and/or your team will be practicing PSIP on your own by following the guides.

## The key to PSIP is understanding where you are starting from, setting goals, and tracking your progress. The way you *implement PSIP* is by creating and using progress tracking cards (PTC).

PSIP consists of eight simple steps.

### **Step 1: Start by Summarizing Current Project Practices.** 

The first step to PSIP, and a lot of planning for that matter, is to have a good idea of the current state and document it. Why? You'll want to have a record of the original state of your project to create a baseline for measuring progress, and to help identify areas that are ready for improvement. To do this, imagine that you are telling a stranger about your project. How do you describe your project? Write a short paragraph summarizing what your project does right now. Use plain language and define your terms. That way, you'll be able to reduce any misunderstandings that might arise from a vague term, or one that may have several meanings to different people. Your goal in this step is to be accurate about your project. Your narrative might look like this:

"this is a placeholder for some text describing an HPC software project."

Step 2 involves setting your goals.
