# Why practice PSIP?

Productivity and Sustainability Improvement Planning (PSIP) is a lightweight, iterative workflow that allows software development teams to identify development bottlenecks and track progress to overcome them. Through the PSIP process, teams are able to realize process improvements, without a disruption to any current development processes.
